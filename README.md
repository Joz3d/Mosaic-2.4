# NCSA Mosaic for X 2.4

What Mosaic *actually* looked like.

This is the final widely used version of Mosaic for X.

tl;dr: Nobody used the Mosaic 2.7 that is going around.  Everybody used this one.  They don't look
the same.

The Situation

Many distro repositories have a version of Mosaic 2.7 that you can install.  Also widely
available as a flatpak, snap, etc.  Most of these are from Alan Dipert's version.  No 
disrespect to the good work that Alan and folks did to update version 2.7, but...

The Problem

Many sites/repos/distribution points advertise said version 2.7 as a way to go back in time 
and "see what the first popular web browser was like".  The problem is that is <b>not</b>  what the
first popular browser looked like!!  Version 2.7 is from 1996... long after Netscape slayed Mosaic, and from when <b>nobody</b> was using Mosaic anymore.  The versions that
everybody used on the early web <b>did not look like that</b>.  The versions that everybody used were
1.2 and 2.0-2.4.

2.4 was released in early 1994.  In summer of '94,
the Windows and Mac versions overtook the X version in feature-set.  By late '94 a lot of 
people were switching to Netscape, and Mosaic was dead by early '95.  
The X version was honestly pretty much dead after the main devs left to work on Netscape.  

So the version 2.7 going around from 2 years after the browser died, updated by a completely different 
NCSA team from the original, and with a different look and feel, was not and should not be a thing.
It's revisionist history.

The Solution

There are great updates of Mosaic 1.0 and 1.2 [locations].  I could not find the source for 
a 2.0-2.4 version until I came across [blah blah's] video and he actually still had it!  
Hence, here is NCSA Mosaic for X 2.4, the last widely used and very popular version of
Mosaic... if you want to actually see what the browsing experience looked like with Mosaic.

I didn't do much here.  I mostly just followed [whoever's] updates that they shared

If all the text is fixed-width single-size, you probably need to 
apt install gsfonts-other gsfonts-x11 and restart your X server.
